## Setting Up the Project
Download the Project:

Click the green "Code" button on the project's GitHub page.
Select "Download ZIP" and save the file to your computer.
Unzip the downloaded file.
Create the .env File:

Inside the unzipped project folder, find a file named .env.example.
Make a copy of this file and rename the copy to .env.
Add Your OpenAI API Key:

Open the .env file you just created using a text editor (like Notepad).
You will see a line that says OPENAI_API_KEY="".
Enter your OpenAI API key between the quotation marks so it looks like this: OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here".
Save and close the file.
